## Welcome to the Advanced Numerical Analysis repository, edited by Alberto Chiusole

Repo for the Advanced Numerical Analysis course @ University of Trieste, containing mainly exercises.
During the course, held by [prof. Paolo Novati](http://www.novati.dmg.units.it/), we investigated different numerical methods to perform approximations.

The following list collects the exercises done so far:

1. [Interpolation using Chebyshev nodes](http://devzero.tk/advanced-numerical-analysis/exercises/01_interpolation_with_cheby.html), using "canonical" polynomial interpolation, Lagrange interpolation and Newton method (not working).

1. [Newton-Cotes quadrature formula for integration](http://devzero.tk/advanced-numerical-analysis/exercises/02_quadratures_with_newton_cotes.html), using Chebyshev nodes.
